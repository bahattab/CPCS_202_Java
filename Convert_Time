//  Convert Time - See sample program: TimeCalculation.java

/*

Write a program to get an amount of time from the user in seconds. Then your program should convert this time into minutes and the remaining seconds.
Remember:
–Step 1: Problem-solving Phase
–Step 2: Implementation Phase

Step 1: Problem-solving Phase
–If you are given seconds, how do you then calculate the minutes and remaining seconds?
    Example:
        –Given 624 seconds, how do we calculate the minutes?
        –We divide by 60!
            •We see how many complete 60s are in 624.
            •Answer: 10 of them. 10x60 = 600.
        –So in 624 seconds, there are a full 10 minutes.
        –After we remove those 10 minutes, how many seconds are remaining?
            •624 –(10x60) = 24 seconds remaining
            •We can use mod! 624%60 = 24 seconds remaining.

Step 1: Design your algorithm
1.Get amount of seconds from the user.
    Use Scanner object
    Save as an int
2.Compute the minutes and seconds remaining:
    From these seconds, determine the number of minutes
        Example:
            –150 seconds => 2 minutes and 30 seconds
            –315 seconds => 5 minutes and 15 seconds
                •315 / 60 = 5 and 315 % 60 = 15
3.Display the result

            int minutes = seconds / 60 ;    //ind minutes
            int remainingSeconds = seconds % 60;    // Seconds temaining
